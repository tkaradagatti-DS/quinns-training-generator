##  **Problem Statement**

Training organisations like **Quinns Training Services** face a major challenge:
creating high-quality training materials (PowerPoints, manuals, assessments, outlines) takes **a lot of manual effort**, requires **experienced trainers**, and often leads to:

* inconsistent training modules
* long preparation time
* difficulty updating materials
* duplicate work across teams
* lack of standardisation in training content
* poor scalability as the number of courses grows

Traditional methods also require trainers to manually:

* analyse documents
* extract topics
* create outlines
* design slides
* write assessments
* format training guides

This slows down delivery and reduces consistency.

# **Project Overview**

The **Quinns Training Generator** is a modern AI-powered training-material generation system built using Streamlit and OpenAI.
